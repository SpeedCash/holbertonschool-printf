**Project Title:** _printf clone

**Description:**
This project is a custom implementation of the C library function printf. Our version, named _printf, replicates the basic functionalities of the standard printf function, allowing formatted output to stdout. It's designed to demonstrate a deep understanding of variadic functions in C, string manipulation, and output handling.

**Compilation Command**
To compile the _printf function and any associated files, use:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o output

**Requirements**
Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Compiler: GCC
Version Control: Git
Please note that while these requirements capture the primary environment and tools used, they do not include all specific requirements of the project.

**Usage Examples**
The _printf clone function can be used in a similar way to the standard printf function. Here are some examples:

**Example 1: Printing a String**
Code:_printf("Hello, World!\n");

**Output on STDOUT:**
Hello, World!

**Example 2: Printing an Integer**
Code: _printf("Number: %d\n", 10);

**Output on STDOUT:**
Number: 10

**Man Page**
Refer to the provided manual page for detailed usage instructions.

**Testing**
Tests for the _printf clone function should cover a variety of use cases. Use the following command for testing with memory leak checks:
valgrind ./output

**Flowchart**
The flowchart detailing the logic of _printf clone is included in the project files. It outlines the handling of different format specifiers and the overall structure of the function.
